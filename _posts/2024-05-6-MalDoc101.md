# Challenge Details:
It is common for threat actors to utilize living off the land (LOTL) techniques, such as the execution of PowerShell to further their attacks and transition from macro code. This challenge is intended to show how you can often times perform quick analysis to extract important IOCs. The focus of this exercise is on static techniques for analysis.

## Tools:

- oledump
- olevba
- CyberChef
- PowerShell
- Text Editor

## File details:

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/…/CTFs/CyberdeFender/malware/maldoc]
└─# file sample.bin

The `.bin` file seemed to be a `Microsoft Office Word` file 
# Challenge questions:

>+ Multiple streams contain macros in this document. Provide the number of the highest one.

Using the command `oledump.py sample.bin `, we can see 

```bash
└─# oledump.py sample.bin                                     
---snippet-------------------
 12:       156 'Macros/VBA/__SRP_3'
 13: M    1367 'Macros/VBA/diakzouxchouz'
 14:       908 'Macros/VBA/dir'
 15: M    5705 'Macros/VBA/govwiahtoozfaid'
 16: m    1187 'Macros/VBA/roubhaol'
 17:        97 'Macros/roubhaol/\x01CompObj'
---snippet-------------------
```
The uppercase letter 'M' signifies that the stream contains a VBA macro with executable code, whereas the lowercase 'm' indicates a VBA macro that contains only attributes or metadata, without executable code.

>+ What event is used to begin the execution of the macros?

Using a command `olevba sample.bin`, Document_open will automatically run the macro once the document is opened.

>+ What malware family was this maldoc attempting to drop?

By using the command `olevba sample.bin`, we determine that the macro named `Document_Open()` is set to execute automatically when the document is opened.

>+ What stream is responsible for the storage of the base64-encoded string?

![Alt text](/assets/img/cb/Maldoc/mc2.png)

According to the results from olevba, it's confirmed that the stream `Macros/roubhaol/i09/o` contains a base64-encoded string. 

To pinpoint the specific stream number of `Macros/roubhaol/i09/o`, I utilized oledump.

Expand Project and Forms to see the name of the userform.

>+ This document contains an obfuscated base64 encoded string; what value is used to pad (or obfuscate) this string?

`oledump.py -s 15 --vbadecompresscorrupt sample.bin `

![Alt text](/assets/img/cb/Maldoc/mc6.png)

>+ What is the program executed by the base64 encoded string? 

Since I already identified the stream responsible for storing the base64-encoded string from question Q.4, I used oledump with the -d option to extract and print the base64 encoded string.

![Alt text](/assets/img/cb/Maldoc/mc7.png)

The Find/Replace operation can be used to remove the added padding string. Copy the answer from Q.6 and paste it into the Find field, ensuring to select "SIMPLE STRING". Leave the Replace field empty.

or use pythons
```python
The base64 is obfuscated using "2342772g3&*gs7712ffvs626fq". Use "print("".join(<string_from_stream_34>.split("2342772g3&*gs7712ffvs626fq")))" python code to deobfuscate it
```
