# Introduction 
## Information Gathering

How about we begin by nmap a scans to check which ports are currently being used?

```yaml
nmap -Pn -sV -A -vv -oN nmap_scans explosion.htb
```

We‚Äôve identified two ports, one for HTTP and the other for HTTPS services. If we visit our machine‚Äôs IP address, we‚Äôll notice a redirect to https://bizness.htb. Let‚Äôs add that to our /etc/hosts file. Afterward, we‚Äôll discover the next page

After delving deeper, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything noteworthy or actionable.

It might be a good idea to search for a subdomain or directory that we currently don‚Äôt have access to.

# Directory Enumeration 
I used dirsearch and uncovered the following üëáüèæ

You discovered a login page within the directory https://bizness.htb/control/login. Upon visiting it, you observed that the page is utilizing Apache OFBiz, the service we need to exploit.

# Vulnerability Analysis

We‚Äôve identified the running service and could search for a CVE to exploit it. When I searched for ‚ÄúApache OFBiz CVE‚Äù on Google, CVEdetails.com provided us with the following relevant information:

CVE-2023-51467 enables Remote Code Execution (RCE). I discovered a Git repository that allows us to test if our target is vulnerable to this exploit.[guthub](https://github.com/jakabakos/Apache-OFBiz-Authentication-Bypass)

This is a Python Script, which is sending request with empty USERNAME and PASSWORD along with requirePasswordChange parameter set to ‚ÄòY‚Äô.We can supply commands as parameter, which will be executed.

# Exploitation

Netcat can be used to listen and granted us access to the target.

I statblized the shell using the following commands

```yaml
script /dev/null -qc /bin/bash
stty raw -echo; fg; ls; export SHELL=/bin/bash; export TERM=screen; stty rows 38 columns 116; reset;
```

or use this if python is insalled  [link](https://maxat-akbanov.com/how-to-stabilize-a-simple-reverse-shell-to-a-fully-interactive-terminal)



I curl linpeas.sh from my machine to the attacking machine and I got nothing so I statred doing manual exploration
After doing some exploration, I found an interesting file in /opt/ofbiz/framework/resources/templates/AdminUserLoginData.xml

 <!-- I found another interesting file, called ‚Äòc54d0.dat‚Äô. This file is located in ‚Äò/opt/ofbiz/runtime/data/derby/ofbiz/seg0‚Äô -->
