# Challenge Questions:

## Basic Static Analysis
### What is the SHA256 hash of the sample?

used the following command in powershell

```yaml
Get-FileHash .\putty.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

### What architecture is this binary?

I checked the binary architecture using PEStudio which was a 32 bit version

### Are there any results from submitting the SHA256 hash to VirusTotal?
yes

###  Describe the results of pulling the strings from this binary. Record and describe any strings that are potentially interesting. Can any interesting information be extracted from the strings?
### Describe the results of inspecting the IAT for this binary. Are there any imports worth noting?

![Alt text](/assets/img/malware/s5.png)

Nothing there was peculiar

### Is it likely that this binary is packed?
-It's not packed binary

By comparing the hexadecimal of the Virtual size and the size of the Raw data, The difference wasnâ€™t much much

## Basic Dynamic Analysis

### Describe initial detonation. Are there any notable occurrences at first detonation? 
- Without internet simulation? 
We do get a normal puddy window and ostensibly we could put anything we want but if you double click again you do a blue flash window that pops up flash
- With internet simulation?
still the same as without the internet simulation
### From the host-based indicators perspective, what is the main payload that is initiated at detonation? What tool can you use to identify this?

> Using procmon 
 we can see a gigantic onliner powershell command line here after we filter the PID section

### What is the DNS record that is queried at detonation?

`bonus2.corporatebonusapplication.local`

![Alt text](/assets/img/malware/s8.png)

###  What is the callback port number at detonation?
> 8443
![Alt text](/assets/img/malware/s9.png)
### How can you use host-based telemetry to identify the DNS record, port, and protocol?

we addes the dns to the hosts file

###  Attempt to get the binary to initiate a shell on the localhost. Does a shell spawn? What is needed for a shell to spawn?
Tried a netcat and had this shell but flushed the dns first

```yaml
ipconfig /flushdns
```
