Started with an Nmap scan and discovered that two ports were open:

```yaml
nmap -Pn -sV -A -vv -oN nmap_scans 10.10.104.203
```

- Port 3389 (RDP): Identified as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

Did dirsearch but got nothing 
```yaml

‚îî‚îÄ# dirsearch -u  http://10.10.104.203 --exclude-status 403,404

I checked the target website using my web browser and found out it was running on WordPress:

Then, I tried using a tool called WPScan to learn more, but I got an error message:

```yaml
can Aborted: The URL supplied redirects to http://localhost/retro/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http://10.10.104.203/retro/wp-admin/&reauth=1. Use the --ignore-main-redirect option to ignore the redirection and scan the target, or change the --url option value to the redirected URL.

```

Still, I didn't give up. I looked around the website carefully and found some potential login details:

- Username: `wade`
- Password: `parzival`

> ## Port 3389

With the credentail acqured I tried to connect to the machine using the remote protocol port with the following command:

```yaml
xfreerdp /v:10.10.104.203 /u:wade /p:parzival /cert:ignore +clipboard /dynamic-resolution /drive:share,/home/sire/Documents/CTFs/TryHackMe/Retro /size:1600x980
```

 and walla, we are in
