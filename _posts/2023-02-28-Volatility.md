# Introduction

Volatility is a free memory forensics tool commonly used by malware and SOC analysts within a blue team or as part of their detection and monitoring solutions. Volatility is written in Python and is made up of python plugins and modules designed as a plug-and-play way of analyzing memory dumps.

Volatility uses different plugins together to gather info from a memory dump. First, you'll ID the image type; we'll discuss how in later tasks. Then, with the image type and other plugins sorted, you can start analyzing the dump using various Volatility plugins covered later. Volatility being separate from the system investigated allows for complete segmentation but full insight into the system's runtime state.

## Memory Extraction

Extracting a memory dump can be performed in numerous ways, varying based on the requirements of your investigation. Listed below are a few of the techniques and tools that can be used to extract a memory from a bare-metal machine.

- FTK Imager
- Redline
- DumpIt.exe
- win32dd.exe / win64dd.exe
- Memoryze
- FastDump

When using an extraction tool on a bare-metal host, it can usually take a considerable amount of time; take this into consideration during your investigation if time is a constraint.


For virtual machines, gathering a memory file can easily be done by collecting the virtual memory file from the host machineâ€™s drive. This file can change depending on the hypervisor used; listed below are a few of the hypervisor virtual memory files you may encounter.

- VMWare - .vmem
- Hyper-V - .bin
- Parallels - .mem
- VirtualBox - .sav file *this is only a partial memory file


# Plugins Overview

Identifying image profiles can be tough without knowing the machine's version and build. Volatility's imageinfo plugin solves this by assigning the best OS profiles to the memory dump, simplifying analysis, especially in Volatility2.

# Listing Processes and Connections
Five different plugins within Volatility allow you to dump processes and network connections, each with varying techniques used. In this task, we will be discussing each and its pros and cons when it comes to evasion techniques used by adversaries

Use pslist to list all processes, including terminated ones, akin to Task Manager.
Syntax: `python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.pslist`

```bash
thmanalyst@ubuntu:/opt/volatility3$ python3 vol.py -f dump.raw windows.pslist

Combat process-hiding techniques like rootkits with psscan, though it may yield false positives. Syntax: `python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.psscan`

```bash
thmanalyst@ubuntu:/opt/volatility3$ python3 vol.py -f dump.raw windows.psscan
Volatility 3 Framework 1.0.1

```

The pstree plugin lists processes based on parent process IDs, offering a comprehensive view of process hierarchy, useful for understanding extraction events. Syntax: `python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.pstree`

Identify network connections with netstat, which can be unstable in older Windows builds; consider using bulk_extractor for stability. Syntax: ` python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.netstat`


This command in the current state of volatility3 can be very unstable, particularly around old Windows builds. To combat this, you can utilize other tools like bulk_extractor to extract a PCAP file from the memory file. In some cases, this is preferred in network connections that you cannot identify from Volatility alone.[link](https://tools.kali.org/forensics/bulk-extractor)

Utilize dlllist to list DLLs associated with processes, aiding in malware detection and analysis. Syntax: `python3 vol.py -f <file> windows.dlllist`

# Volatility Hunting and Detection Capabilities
Volatility offers a plethora of plugins that can be used to aid in your hunting and detection capabilities when hunting for malware or other anomalies within a system's memory.

`malfind` will attempt to identify injected processes and their PIDs along with the offset address and a Hex, Ascii, and Disassembly view of the infected area. The plugin works by scanning the heap and identifying processes that have the executable bit set RWE or RX and/or no memory-mapped file on disk (file-less malware). Based on what `malfind` identifies, the injected area will change. An MZ header is an indicator of a Windows executable file. The injected area could also be directed towards shellcode which requires further analysis.

```bash
thmanalyst@ubuntu:/opt/volatility3$ python3 vol.py -f dump.raw windows.malfind

# Advanced Memory Forensics

Advanced Memory Forensics can be daunting, especially without experience in system object interactions or malware techniques like hooking and driver manipulation. Dealing with advanced adversaries often means confronting rootkits with sophisticated evasion tactics, necessitating analysis of drivers, mutexes, and hooked functions to uncover hidden malware.

The first evasion technique we will be hunting is hooking; there are five methods of hooking employed by adversaries, outlined below:

- SSDT Hooks
- IRP Hooks
- IAT Hooks
- EAT Hooks
- Inline Hooks


The `ssdt` plugin will search for hooking and output its results. Hooking can be used by legitimate applications, so it is up to you as the analyst to identify what is evil. As a brief overview of what SSDT hooking is: SSDT stands for System Service Descriptor Table; the Windows kernel uses this table to look up system functions. An adversary can hook into this table and modify pointers to point to a location the rootkit controls.

The `modules` plugin will dump a list of loaded kernel modules; this can be useful in identifying active malware. However, if a malicious file is idly waiting or hidden, this plugin may miss it.

The `driverscan` plugin will scan for drivers present on the system at the time of extraction. This plugin can help to identify driver files in the kernel that the modules plugin might have missed or were hidden.

There are also other plugins listed below that can be helpful when attempting to hunt for advanced malware in memory.
: modscan, 
driverirp, 
callbacks, 
idt, 
apihooks, 
moddump and
handles
